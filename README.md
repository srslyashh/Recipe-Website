## Description

Recipe Finder is a web application that empowers users to discover recipes based on the ingredients they have on hand. It offers a user-friendly interface for searching recipes by categories, dietary preferences, and specific ingredients. Users can explore various cuisines and cooking ideas, find detailed recipe information, and even view mouthwatering images of the dishes they want to prepare.

## APIs

We leverage the following APIs to provide a rich recipe-finding experience:

- **Spoonacular API**: [Spoonacular Food API](https://spoonacular.com/food-api) serves as the backbone of our application, offering access to a vast database of recipes and ingredients.

  - `recipes/complexSearch`: This endpoint enables extensive searching and filtering options, allowing users to pinpoint the perfect recipe based on their preferences. It plays a significant role in our "Categories" page.

  - `recipes/findByIngredients`: Users can utilize this endpoint to discover recipes they can cook right away by specifying the ingredients they have in their kitchen.

  - `recipes/{id}/information`: We use this endpoint to gather detailed information about specific recipes. It populates our recipe cards on the website, including enticing images.
